Business Overview The Accounting Service manages financial accounts and applies business rules when processing credits and debits. It ensures the integrity of balances and enforces standard accounting constraints. ## 2. Core Business Entities ### Account - Represents a customer or system-owned ledger. - Attributes: - Account Number (unique) - Name - Balance (BigDecimal) ### Transaction - Represents money movement. - Types: - CREDIT \u2192 increases balance - DEBIT \u2192 decreases balance - Business rules enforced: - No negative balances allowed. - Amount must be positive. - Debit cannot exceed current balance. ## 3. Key Business Rules for Test Generation 1. Every account starts with a zero balance.",

Every account starts with a zero balance.\n\n2. Account numbers must be unique. 3. CREDIT transactions: - Must accept positive amounts. - Must correctly update balance. 4. DEBIT transactions: - Must reject amounts larger than current balance. - Must handle exact balance debit gracefully. 5. Error handling: - \u201cAccount not found\u201d - \u201cInvalid amount\u201d - \u201cInsufficient balance\u201d ## 4. Example Business Scenarios ### Scenario 1 \u2014 Basic Credit Flow - Create Account ACC1001 - Post CREDIT of 500 - Expected balance \u2192 500 ### Scenario 2 \u2014 Debit With Sufficient Balance - Debit 200 from balance 500 - Expected balance \u2192 300 ### Scenario 3 \u2014 Debit With Insufficient Balance - Attempt to debit 600 from balance 300 - Expected \u2192 Error: Insufficient balance ### Scenario 4 \u2014 Multiple Transactions - CREDIT 1000",

Purpose for AI Test Generation This domain knowledge allows the AI agent to: - Understand business constraints - Generate meaningful unit & integration tests - Validate error scenarios - Cover edge cases and boundary conditions - Produce reliable JUnit tests that match accounting rules ## 6. Notes This document is intended for RAG ingestion so the agent can produce smarter, context-rich test cases for svc-accounting.",
